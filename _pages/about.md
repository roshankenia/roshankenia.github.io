I am currently an undergraduate researcher in Dr. Zhaozheng Yin's lab at Stony Brook University, focussing on the problem of learning with noisy labels in machine learning. Previously, I was a research assistant in Koo Lab at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. My academic and research interests include machine learning, medical imaging, computer vision, genomic deep learning and more. In my spare time, I like to learn Hindi, go on runs, watch college football, and listen to rap.
