- Researched the functional impact of genomic mutations through a computational lens using machine learning solutions.
- Conducted a two semester long project with Dr. Peter Koo involved with distilling knowledge from a teacher network to a student network as a regularization technique in order to build a more general and less overfitted model.
- Compared model interpretability using methods such as saliency maps, integrated gradients, and in-silico mutagenesis.
