title: "Knowledge Distillation in Genomic Deep Learning"
excerpt: "Koo Laboratory (2020 - 2021)"
collection: research
---
- Researched the functional impact of genomic mutations through a computational lens using machine learning solutions.
- Conducted a two semester long project with [Dr. Peter Koo](https://koolab.cshl.edu/) involved with distilling knowledge from a teacher network to a student network as a regularization technique in order to build a more general and less overfitted model.
- Compared model interpretability using methods such as saliency maps, integrated gradients, and in-silico mutagenesis.
