**About Me**  

I am a second-year Master’s student in Computer Science at Columbia University, expected to graduate in May 2025. Currently, I am a Graduate Research Assistant in the [AI4VS Lab](https://ai4vs.cs.columbia.edu/) at Columbia University, working under the guidance of [Dr. Kaveri Thakoor](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~kthakoor/). My research focuses on developing anatomically guided cross-attention mechanisms and hybrid deep learning models for 3D medical imaging, with applications in glaucoma and AMD detection. Previously, I conducted research at MIT Lincoln Laboratory, focusing on biomedical imaging and weakly supervised learning, and at [Dr. Zhaozheng Yin's Lab](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~zyin/index.htm) at Stony Brook University, where I developed computer vision solutions for nuclear reactor safety. My early research experience was with [Koo Lab](https://koolab.cshl.edu/) at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, exploring genomic deep learning and interpretability.  

In my spare time, I enjoy running, watching college football and *Jeopardy!*, playing squash, and gardening.  

**My Interests**  

My research interests lie at the intersection of artificial intelligence, computer vision, and medical imaging. Specifically, I focus on designing interpretable deep learning models for 3D medical data, leveraging weakly supervised and self-supervised learning approaches. My work aims to bridge the gap between clinicians and machine learning models, ensuring reliable and clinically relevant outputs. Additionally, I have a strong interest in diffusion models, genomic deep learning, and leveraging domain-specific data to address real-world challenges in healthcare.
