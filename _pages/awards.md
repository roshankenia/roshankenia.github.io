**About Me**

I am a senior undergraduate Computer Science & Math major at Stony Brook University expected to graduate in May 2023. Currently, I research with Dr. Zhaozheng Yin at Stony Brook University in his machine learning and biomedical informatics lab. Previously, I was a research assistant in Koo Lab at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory which focused on genomic deep learning and its interpretability. In my spare time, I like to learn Hindi, go on runs, watch college football and Jeopardy, and listen to rap.

**My Interests**

My research interests include machine learning, computer vision, medical imaging, and genomic deep learning. My main research focuses on developing semi-supervised techniques and data augmentation methods to build robust models that can be trained under the presence of noisy labels within a dataset. My academic interests include the broad field of artificial intelligence and its use in all applicable aspects of computer science.
